# About Me

I'm [Ali Abbas Jaffri](https://aliabbasjaffri.github.io/) and i've been working in the space of MLOps since the fall of 2019. It started off during the course of my Master's thesis at TUM but soon grew into a passion. I've been working ever since on the deployment of ML infrastructure.

I started this project in the midst of 2023 after having deliberated on the issue of quick deployment of ML infrastructure. In my successive role, it became more and more clear that the knowledge to deploy ML Infrastructure lies defragmented all across the internet across different toolings deployment pages and there's no quick way to deploy different toolings in a MLOps stack quickly and with best practices. This slows down platform teams who would either:

- want to iterate over a couple of different toolings in different MLOps stacks to suite their requirements
- or just want deploy ML Infrastructure with best practices without having to spend months of sprints and plannings to achieve the task.
- or just simply want to try out a new tool but don't want to spend too much time in going through the deployment docs!

Platinfra soon grew to be something that i very closely related myself with.
