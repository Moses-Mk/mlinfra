# About Me

I'm [Ali Abbas Jaffri](https://aliabbasjaffri.github.io/) and i've been working in the space of MLOps since the fall of 2019. It started off during the course of my Master's thesis at TUM but soon grew into a passion. I've been working ever since on the deployment of ML infrastructure.

I started this project in the midst of 2023 after having deliberated on the issue of quick deployment of ML infrastructure. In my successive role, it became more and more clear that the knowledge to deploy ML Infrastructure lies defragmented all across the internet across different toolings deployment pages and there's no quick way to deploy different toolings in a MLOps stack quickly and with best practices. This slows down platform teams who would either:

- experiment with different toolings in MLOps stacks to tailor-fit their requirements.
- quickly test out new tools without the burden of sifting through extensive deployment documentation.
- efficiently deploy MLOps stack tools with best practices, avoiding the drain of lengthy sprints and intricate planning.

Platinfra emerged from my personal need to address these challenges. As I shared my experiences with fellow platform enthusiasts, I realized I was not alone in this journey. I compiled my insights on deploying various MLOps stacks in different environments into this tool, aspiring to simplify the deployment process across all cloud providers and platform tools. I genuinely hope you find Platinfra as useful and transformative as I envisioned and hope you enjoy using it!
