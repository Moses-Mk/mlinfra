# Welcome to platinfra

`platinfra` came to be when i started exploring the different tools in mlops space and had the intention of deploying them on the cloud. The idea was to liberate the IaC logic for creating MLOps stacks and accelerate the deployment and decision making process for MLOps engineers so that they can focus where it matters; on choosing the right tooling for their workflows.
