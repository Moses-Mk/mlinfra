- This project is heavily inspired by [opta](https://github.com/run-x/opta), a tool quite ahead of its time, and got discontinued way before its time. I would like to thank the team behind it for their work and providing me inspiration to condense the idea of deployment of MLOps tools into a single tool.
- The project leans heavily on [terraform aws modules](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/) by [Anton Babenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonbabenko/) for the AWS infrastructure.
- I would also like to thank the following individuals:
  - [Ghania Riaz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghaniariaz) for her patience in bearing me with a laptop on weekdays, holidays and our vacations!
  - [Nicholas Junge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-junge/) for his valuable feedback and support in the early stages of this project.
  - [Hamza Tahir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamzatahirofficial); an old friend and an endless source of inspiration on my journey in the MLOps space.
