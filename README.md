# ultimate-mlops-stacks
Compiling terraform code for deployment of multiple MLOps toolings to be deployed in a single command

- My intention behind this work is to liberate IaC logic for creating MLOps stacks which is usually tied to other frameworks.

- All you need is terraform to run this project and `let it rip!`
